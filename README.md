# ITCapstone
IT Capstone Group Project


**Project Overview:** 
Throughout your degree program you have developed a skill set of programming and IT.  You will demonstrate in this course that you can apply this skill set to build a full blown web application and a query application.  Here are the key elements of building a full stack web application and query application:

Element 1: User interface (Front end) - Website (Built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript). ** Do not attempt to build this in Spring Boot, Angular, or similar.

Element 2: Database - This database has to be developed using SQL, or MySQL, or SQLite, or NoSQL, or MongoDB  (No MS Access Database).  This database will be used to store data that your Query application and Website will send and retrieve data.

Element 3: Programming Language (Back End) - The program (Query Application) must use either C, Java, C++, or C#.  **Note this application is separate from the website.  You may use a Framework to help with connectivity to the database.

Element 4: The website and database must be deployed on a server located in the cloud, or web hosting service.  **Examples: Bluehost, Hostgator, Google Cloud, Azure, AWS.

Element 5: Use a repository to store all code.  **An example of a repository is Git Hub.  

Element 6: Use a project management tool to track all assigned tasks and to track the progress of the application. **MS Project is an example.

**Project Requirements: **
Your group will build a full stack project that will demonstrate the skills learned in the program.  Keep in mind that to assess these skills, we created a project to meet the needs of the outcomes.  While you are always welcome to add pieces to your project, you are not allowed to remove any items required from the project. 

The project we are building is an online shopping website.  The online shopping website will have the ability to shop for clothing (shirts, pants, sweaters, shorts).  It should have two categories (men, women).  It should have the following sizes for both categories (small, medium, large, xtra large).  The website should have a log-in screen (login and signup).  You should have a screen for the shopping cart.  Once the order is placed, you should have a confirmation page.  

All data from the website once the order is placed should be stored in the database.  The database will store the customer login information, order history, and inventory for the website.  It will connect to the website and the query application.

The query application will be able to retrieve information from the database.  It will have a menu to produce the following tasks: 1) Print all the customers and their login information, 2) Order history for each user (personalized by each user. Do not print all users and order history at once).

As mentioned, all code should be stored on a repository.  The website needs to be deployed on a server (cloud or local machine).  The query application must be deployed for me to run (Executable file.  I will not open an IDE to run it).
